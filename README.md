# Binomial-Asset-Pricing-Model
In this project, we will be breaking down the theory described and published in Steven Shreve’s book’s Stochastic Calculus for Finance I & II. As a guide for implementing these concepts in Python, we will refer to the numerical methods and practices outlined in Les Clewlow & Chris Strickland’s book Implementing Derivatives Models. 

We will go through two implementations of a simple binomial tree model in Python, one that will use ‘for loops’ to step through each node at each time step (a function I have defined as binomial tree slow), and the other (binomial tree fast) will vectorize these steps using numpy arrays, improving overall computation time as N time steps increase. Although not necessary for python notebook 'Binomial_Option_Pricing_Model.ipynb', using numpy arrays and vectorizing our calculations will improve computations as we delve deeper into financial mathematics and implementation heading forward.

We look at pricing Barrier Options using the Binomial Asset Pricing Model and see how we can implement the barrier tree model to price an up-and-out barrier option in Python. There are two types of barrier options which we look at in 'Barrier_Options_with_Binomial_Trees.ipynb', up-and-out barrier options and down-and-out barrier options. Here we go through the theory and implementation.

We look at pricing American Options using the Binomial Asset Pricing Model and see how we can implement the binomial tree model to price an American option in Python in 'American_Option_Pricing_with_Binomial_Trees.ipynb' notebook. We also see why it is not optimal to early exercise an American Call option with no dividend (or positive interest rates).
