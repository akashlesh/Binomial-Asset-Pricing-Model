# Binomial-Asset-Pricing-Model
In this project, we will be breaking down the theory described and published in Steven Shreve’s book’s Stochastic Calculus for Finance I & II. As a guide for implementing these concepts in Python, we will refer to the numerical methods and practices outlined in Les Clewlow & Chris Strickland’s book Implementing Derivatives Models. 

We will go through two implementations of a simple binomial tree model in Python, one that will use ‘for loops’ to step through each node at each time step (a function I have defined as binomial tree slow), and the other (binomial tree fast) will vectorize these steps using numpy arrays, improving overall computation time as N time steps increase. Although not necessary for python notebook , using numpy arrays and vectorizing our calculations will improve computations as we delve deeper into financial mathematics and implementation heading forward.
